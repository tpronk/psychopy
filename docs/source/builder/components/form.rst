Form Component
--------------

The Form component enables Psychopy to be used as a questionnaire tool, where
participants can be presented with a series of questions requiring responses.
Form items, defined as questions and response pairs, are presented
simultaneously onscreen with a scrollable viewing window.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

Name : string
    Everything in a PsychoPy experiment needs a unique name. The name should contain only letters, numbers and underscores (no punctuation marks or spaces).

Start : int, float
    The time that the stimulus should first appear.

Stop : int, float
    Governs the duration for which the stimulus is presented.

Items : List of dicts or csv / xlsx file
    A list of dicts or csv file should have the following key, value pairs / column headers:
        *index*
            The item index as a number
        *itemText*
            The item question string
        *itemWidth*
            The question width between 0 : 1
        *type*
            The type of rating e.g., 'radio', 'rating', 'slider'
        *responseWidth*
            The question width between 0 : 1
        *options*

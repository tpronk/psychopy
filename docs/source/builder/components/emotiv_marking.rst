.. _emotiv_marking:

Emotiv Marking Component
-------------------------------

The Emotiv Marking component causes Psychopy to send a marker to the EEG datastream at the
time that the stimuli are presented.

For the Emotiv Marking component to work an emotiv_recording component should have already
been added to the experiment.

By default markers with labels and values can be added.  A time interval can be specified
by sending a stop marker. If the Marker intervals overlap it is important that the labels are
unique. Additionally the length of the interval
must be greater than 0.2 seconds.  If you need higher speeds than this, it is best to
record the times of your markers manually and compare them to the times in the raw EEG data.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Name : string
    Everything in a PsychoPy experiment needs a unique name. The name should contain only
    letters, numbers and underscores (no punctuation marks or spaces).

Start :
    The time to send the marker to the EEG datastream

Stop Marker:
    If selected the stop marker will be sent as specified by the Stop parameter. If no stop
    marker is sent then the marker will be an "instance" marker and will indicate a point in
    time. If a stop marker is sent the marker will be an "interval" marker and have a
    startDatetime and endDatetime associated with it.

Stop :
    Governs the duration for which the stimulus is presented. See :ref:`startStop` for details.

marker label : string
    The label assigned to this marker

marker value : int
    The value assigned to this marker

stop marker : bool
    Whether or not this is a stop marker

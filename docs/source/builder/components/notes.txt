1) When the Vector class is implemented, all stimuli with a position param will also have an "anchor" param - this is essentially "where on the stimulus is the position set from" - you can see how this will work in Textbox which already has an "anchor"
2) When the Color class is implemented, there will be a lot more colour spaces. You can see what these will be in:
    psychopy.colors.colorSpaces
3) Should we add in things like "Save onset/offset times"? They're not in the docs currently but it might be good for users to know what they are, especially now that there's a clear structure to it
4) What are we doing about case? Currently the labels in Builder are inconsistent, should we unify it and make it all title case?
5) With param types, should we avoid using words like "boolean" which may not be understandable to non-programmers?
6) Should we automate bits which are in everything, like Name or Start/Stop?

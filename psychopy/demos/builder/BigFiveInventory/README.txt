Personality Inventories - Form Class Demonstration
---------------------------------------------------

The experiment:

    This is a demonstration of how to create forms in PsychoPy. We're doing a personality inventory as a demonstration. We've included a few options, all measuring the Big Five (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism; Goldberg 1993). The options we provide have different lengths though:

 - TIPI: The Ten Item Personality Inventory (Gosling et al, 2003)
 - mini_IPIP: The mini IPIP (Donnellan et al, 2006) with 20 items abbrieviated from the IPIP (Goldberg 1999)
 - The Big Five Inventory (John & Srivastava, 1999) with 44-items

Implementation:

    The forms are included as different Routines so you can add/remove them from the Flow easily if you want to switch to a different one.

    Each of the forms has been given a "Continue" button using the Code Component but that only becomes active when the form is marked "complete" as you can see in the Each Frame code of the Code Component.
